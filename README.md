This is a replication of the original codebase, but in JAX. The original codebase is in PyTorch and can be found here: https://github.com/vijaydwivedi75/gnn-lspe
data/molecules and configs is copied from the original codebase.

To setup the envionment 
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gnn-lspe-jax
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
TO TEST: should just be the conda env create as added pip requirements to it
